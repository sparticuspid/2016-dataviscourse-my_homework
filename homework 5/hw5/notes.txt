The first visualization is good because it uses position and length as visual encodings, two of the most effective channels for allowing comparison between item attributes. This chart would also have a color gradient for the square and triangle marks to double encode the win percentage for that year, which would help to reinforce the position visualization. The different marks for 2012 and 2016 are good for clearly identifying the before and after period.  Another effective aspect of this visualization is that it would be ordered from highest change in republican win percentage to highest change in democrat percentage so that,  even though we can’t use alignment in the visualization, we can order the elements in such a way as to make comparison easier. 
The second visualization is good, particularly for seeing overall trends. If the clustering of points occurs above the diagonal line, you could clearly see the shift from democrat to republican win percentage and vice versa. This visualization is effective because the size of the circles can encode the number of electoral votes each state commands, and you can see the weighted impact of the change in win percentage. Additionally, this visualization uses position effectively as a channel for allowing comparison between elements, which is one of the most effective channels in portraying true comparison.
